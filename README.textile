*floor examples*

*nbody:*
* N-body simulation to demonstrate local/shared memory buffers, local memory barriers, OpenGL buffer sharing, loop unrolling and that high performance computing is indeed possible with this toolchain
* build with "./build.sh" inside the folder

*path_tracer:*
* a simple path tracer to demonstrate SPIR/PTX/Metal compilation, execution (as well as rudimentary host execution) and some mildly complex C++14 code
* build with "./build.sh" inside the folder

*img:*
* small program to demonstrate image functionality by doing a gaussian blur (implemented with manual local memory caching as well as a "dumb" version, running the same code as the also provided GLSL implementation)
* build with "./build.sh" inside the folder

*occ:*
* offline-compute-compiler, compiles compute C++ code to SPIR/PTX/Metal/AppleCL code/binaries (see "--help":https://github.com/a2flo/floor_examples/blob/master/offline_compiler/src/main.cpp#L59 for all options)
* build with "./build.sh" inside the folder
