*floor examples*

*warp:*
* image-based warping, implemented using a scatter-based approach and a gather-based approach (based on "Image-Based Bidirectional Scene Reprojection")
* build with "./build.sh" inside the folder
* gather-based warping ref: http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~gfx/pmwiki/index.php?n=Pubs.Yang2011IBB
* NOTE: in addition to floor + dependencies, this requires SDL2_image with libpng, as well as "libwarp":https://github.com/a2flo/libwarp

*nbody:*
* N-body simulation to demonstrate local/shared memory buffers, local memory barriers, OpenGL and Metal buffer sharing, loop unrolling and that high performance computing is indeed possible with this toolchain
* build with "./build.sh" inside the folder

*hlbvh:*
* triangle/triangle collision detection of animated meshes using HLBVH (constructed per-step/frame)
* build with "./build.sh" inside the folder
* ref: https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/publications/karras2012hpg_paper.pdf

*path_tracer:*
* a simple path tracer to demonstrate compute code compilation and execution, as well as some mildly complex C++14 code
* build with "./build.sh" inside the folder

*reduction:*
* simple (WIP) reduction example that showcases 3 different reduce implementations: local/shared memory reduce, shuffle reduce and CUDA coop kernel + shuffle reduce

*img:*
* small program to demonstrate image functionality by doing a gaussian blur (implemented with manual local memory caching as well as a "dumb" version, running the same code as the also provided GLSL implementation)
* build with "./build.sh" inside the folder

*occ:*
* offline-compute-compiler, compiles compute/graphics C++ code to CUDA/PTX, Metal/AIR, OpenCL/SPIR/SPIR-V, Vulkan/SPIR-V code/binaries (see "--help":https://github.com/a2flo/floor_examples/blob/master/offline_compiler/src/main.cpp#L82 for all options)
* build with "./build.sh" inside the folder
